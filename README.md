# Digital Twin Optimisation
MR sequence design using digital twins of non-idealized hardware.

This code has the following dependencies: https://github.com/MRsources/MRzero-Core/tree/variable-initial-mag (MRzero functionality) and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10849727 (coil sensitivities). The latter should be downloaded and saved in a sub-directory called 'data'. An arXiv pre-print for this work can be found at: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17575
